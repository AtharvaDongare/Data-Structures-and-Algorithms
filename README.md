# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
We try to display all the data structures in the most popular languages out there, for the first iteration we plan to release to the snippets using CPP and JAVA, which we will be extending in forth coming days.

This repo is aimed at revisiting the basics of the DSA for the contributors as well as for the users.
